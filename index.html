            <p style="font-size: large;">OFC I first saw on the first day of college, I even told you about it sooo many times but ngl that is real <i>precious</i> in my treasured memory of us haha. Let me say it again one more time!! (DO NOT GET BORED OR SKIP A SINGLE LINE I'LL FUCKING GET UPSET as I can't beat you lol) so that was <strong>8 JUNE 2023</strong>(a pretty memorable date  now) I saw you right after I  entered the class you were sitting with someone and I was sure that I'll sit at back benches so I headed there I was really annoyed but not because of you ofc. Then the class started and we had to give our intro I still remember you wearing a yellow kurti(I AIN'T WEIRD) and with a pony tail ig <i>ANIWAII</i> I suddenly was all ears the moment it was your bench's turn and I ain't lyinng. I found you pretty rude and cool lol, then the next day when you had convo with that English ma'am I was sure that this bitch is cool af I wanted to interact with you too but but imma introverted ass so I didn't then the days passed and because of that first bencher I talked with you and then we exchanged insta ID's and numbers and the rest is a beautiful shit that I will remember for a real long time.</p>
